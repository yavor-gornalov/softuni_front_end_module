# Front-End - Module
This repository contains solutions to tasks related to problems solved during the study of the 'HTML & CSS' and 'JS Front-End' courses at SoftUni.

### HTML & CSS
The goal of the "HTML & CSS" course is to provide fundamental knowledge in web technologies, specifically focusing on HTML5 and CSS3. Students acquire initial knowledge in web development, web browsers, tools for HTML/CSS/DOM development, and practical skills in using HTML for web content description and CSS for web content styling. The course covers basic HTML tags, paragraphs, lists, tables, forms, controls, and semantic HTML tags. It emphasizes basic CSS selectors and styles, working with classes, presentation rules, positioning rules, and layout in CSS. The latest updates of HTML5 and CSS3 standards are also covered. Practical exercises with HTML and CSS engage students in real projects for creating web pages, implementing website fragments, and creating modern websites with good design, contemporary structure, and mobile support.

### JS Front-End
In the "JS Front-End" course, students will gain basic knowledge in the JavaScript language, covering syntax basics, working with arrays, matrices, objects, classes, and writing functions. The course will develop their algorithmic thinking. Upon successful completion of this course, they will be able to work with the DOM tree, manipulate it, and work with events. Functional and OOP approaches to programming with JavaScript will be explored. Concepts for data transmission through HTTP and REST will also be studied.
